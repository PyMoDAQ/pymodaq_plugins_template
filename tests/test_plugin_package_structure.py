"""Acceptance tests of the plugin, provided by PyMoDAQ (from version 5.3.1).

They check the package structure, the entry points, the naming of the instrument modules and classes, the mandatory
attributes and methods of the plugin classes, and apply the static rules of PyMoDAQ on the sources
(see https://pymodaq.cnrs.fr/en/latest/developer_folder/instrument_plugins.html#testing-your-plugin).

The unfinished parts of the plugin (TODO comments, placeholders) are listed but do not fail the tests, set
``fail_on = 'todo'`` before a release. Add your own tests, specific to your instruments, in other files.
